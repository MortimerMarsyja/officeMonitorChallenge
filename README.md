## Instructions 

-Git clone the project
-npm i
-npm start

## Things that I would do with more time

-Improve the interface stylewise, I will most likely do it aniway later.
-Include a handler in the components to manually sort the issues of shortages or low / too high temperature.

This test was meant to be done in 2 hours however it took me much more because I missread the excercise and created a whole react project.
